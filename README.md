# HighFive

###Quick! Where are we eating?

HighFive is an in-dash app that allows you to locate the Top 5 restaurants in 5 categories in your current area. 

HighFive's sleek layout and ease of use is aimed at minimizing driver distraction, while allowing the driver to search for dining options. To further minimize driver distraction, the app can speak restaurant descriptions to the driver. This feature leverages the [Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html#tts-section).

###Results 

HighFive makes use of two APIs from Google; Maps and Places. These are combined to give the user access to HighFives key services which are a title a rating, a distance, and a description.
