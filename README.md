# HighFive

Welcome to the HighFive project repo!

This is the final Detroit Lab's Gamma Apprentice Class Group project.

HighFive is an in-dash app that allows you to locate the Top 5 restaurants in 5 categories in your current area. HighFive's sleek layout and ease of use is aimed at minimizing driver distraction, while allowing the driver to search for dining options.
